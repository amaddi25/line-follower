This is the summarized documentation for the R4D5 robot and will discuss the process, logic, and tools used. The project was completed in a span of 5 weeks and has the following functions to execute:
- Linear line tracking
- Turn various sized curves
- Not be affected by line breaks
- Not be affected by intersections
- Avoid obstacles
- Stop in an end-zone
- Find its way back to the start-zone
  
The goal of the project was for the robot to navigate any track with the above stated elements arranged in a randomized order with sufficient speed and reliability.

The following links will discuss the hardware, electronics, software, and analysis involved with building the robot pictured below.
