This is the summarized documentation for the R4D5 robot and will discuss the process, logic, and tools used. The project was completed in a span of 5 weeks and has the following functions to execute:
- Linear line tracking
- Turn various sized curves
- Not be affected by line breaks
- Not be affected by intersections
- Avoid obstacles
- Stop in an end-zone
- Find its way back to the start-zone
  
The goal of the project was for the robot to navigate any track with the above stated elements arranged in a randomized order with sufficient speed and reliability.

The following links will discuss the hardware, electronics, software, and analysis involved with building the robot pictured below.

Challenges

(talk about the period causing motors to pulsate and not reach the desired duty cycle, closed loop)

suggestions

talk about these
(add closed loop, use bno055 to keep track of robots absolute position and be able to find its way back to the start, get more sensors, a more robust obstacle detection algorithm using a time of flight sensor)



checklist:
finish readme
software page - doxygen, fsm, task diagram
analysis page - math
upload code
