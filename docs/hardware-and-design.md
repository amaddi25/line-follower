# Hardware & Design

### Romi
The base of the robot is the romi kit, the details of which can be found at [Romi](https://www.pololu.com/category/202/romi-chassis-and-accessories).

For a better 3D view with accurate geometry and dimensions, the solidworks of the kit assembly was utilized:

The kit was assembled with M2.5 fasteners and standoffs. Additionally, an acrylic adapter plate was laser cut to allow the microcontroller to rest above the romi power board.

### R4D5 Shell
The outer shell was inspired by STAR WARS astromechs which best suit the shape of the Romi. The shell is split up into three main components:
- Legs
- Body
- Head

For the time and scope of the project, only a stripped down model was designed to house all the Romi components. The STL for the parts are as follows:
